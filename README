The purpose of this assignment was to utilize the JUnit test suite for the List abstract datatype using the List.java interface given to us. Overall, the assignment was pretty straightforward, since the format for all the various testing methods is very similar. However, there was some confusion caused by the wrong order of arguments for the assertEquals method in the QueueTest.java example given to us. This assignment allowed us to see how JUnit can be used to better modularization of tests for a class or program, as well as how useful it can be for debugging all methods since it continues even if an assert fails. This took us about 3 hours to complete.
